              NetWide Assembler for the SciTech MGL
              -------------------------------------

This is a modified distribution of NASM, the Netwide Assembler. NASM
is a prototype general-purpose x86 assembler. It will currently output
flat-form binary files, a.out, COFF and ELF Unix object files,
Microsoft Win32 and 16-bit DOS object files, OS/2 object files, the
as86 object format, and a home-grown format called RDF.

This version of NASM has been modified by SciTech Software such that it
can be used to assemble source code in the SciTech MGL graphics library,
and understands enough of TASM assembler syntax such that both NASM
and TASM can be used to generate assembler modules for the MGL graphics
library. A complete macro package is provided as part of the SciTech
MGL that provides macros to help in building modules that will work with
either assembler.

A pre-compiled binary of NASM is provided as part of the SciTech MGL
graphics library, however you may re-build the assembler from the sources
provided. To do so make sure you have the SciTech Makefile Utilties
correctly configured for your compiler, and then simly type:

    unset DBG
    dmake OPT=1

to build an optimised, non-debug version of the assembler. If you wish
to rebuild for a different OS other than DOS or Win32, you will need to
first compile the DMAKE make program for your OS. See the DMAKE source
code for more information.
