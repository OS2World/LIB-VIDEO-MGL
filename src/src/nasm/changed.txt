Files changes from NASM 0.98 archives
-------------------------------------

All changes can be compiled in and out using the TASM_COMPAT macros,
and when compiled without TASM_COMPAT defined we get the exact same
binary as the unmodified 0.98 sources.

standard.mac:
macros.c:
 . Added macros to ignore TASM directives before first include

nasm.h:
 . Added extern declaration for tasm_compatible_mode

nasm.c:
 . Added global variable tasm_compatible_mode
 . Added command line switch for TASM compatible mode (-t)
 . Changed version command line to reflect when compiled with TASM additions
 . Added response file processing to allow all arguments on a single
   line (response file is @resp rather than -@resp for NASM format).

labels.c:
 . Changes islocal() macro to support TASM style @@local labels.
 . Added islocalchar() macro to support TASM style @@local labels.

parser.c:
 . Added support for TASM style memory references (ie: mov [DWORD eax],10
   rather than the NASM style mov DWORD [eax],10).

preproc.c:
 . Added new directives, %arg, %local, %stacksize to directives table
 . Added support for TASM style directives without a leading % symbol.
