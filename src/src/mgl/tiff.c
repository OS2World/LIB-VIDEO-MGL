* Description:	TIFF bitmap resource loading/unloading routines. We support
*				loading and saving of 24-bit imagery files, since the TIFF
*				format is RGB only. If you load a TIFF into an 8-bit device
*				context, it will be dithered. If you save a TIFF file from
*				an 8bpp device context it will be converted to a 24-bit
*				file when written to disk. Hence if you plan to edit TIFF
*				files and then save the results to disk, do this with
*				a 24-bpp display or memory DC for the best results.
