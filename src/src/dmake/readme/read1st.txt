DMAKE 4.1 [http://dmake.wticorp.com/]
-------------------------------------

This directory tree contains a number of files.  Here is a short
description of what each file contains so that you do not need to
search as much.  There is also a recommended order for reading them.

	read1st.txt	- index of files found in the readme directory.
	intro.txt      	- short note describing what 'dmake' is and where to
			  get it from.
	release.txt	- changes from previous release, and release specific
			  notes.
	../man		- directory containing DMAKE manual page.

	patchX		- release notes for patchX to the current release.

   gold/install.txt	- installation instructions for the Dmake Gold release
 public/install.txt	- installation files for the Dmake public release

The next group of files provides additional information for specific
platforms.  These are found in the appropriate gold and public release
sub-folders.

	apple.mac	- information for macintosh users
	atari.tos	- information for ATARI TOS users
	msdos		- information for MSDOS users
	winnt           - information for Win95 and WinNT users
	os2		- information for OS/2 users
	unix		- information for UNIX users
	qssl-qnx	- information for QNX users
	srcorg          - information on the source code organization

You should read the information in the first group of files.  The
second group of files contains platform specific configuration
information and information that may assist you in building dmake on
the related target system.  You need to read the relevant file only if
you are building the dmake executable from the source distribution
using 'dmake' itself, or if you want to create a new version of dmake.

You can also obtain relevant dmake information by checking out the
Official Dmake Web pages at "http://dmake.wticorp.com/".
