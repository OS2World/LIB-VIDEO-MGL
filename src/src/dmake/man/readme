This directory contains the DMAKE manual page.  The typeset version of the
manual is compressed and uuencoded as this is the only reasonable method of
shipping the control-character filled manpage around.

To unpack the typeset manual page please issue the following sequence of
commands:

	uudecode dmake.uue
	uncompress dmake.Z
	mv dmake dmake.p

NOTE:  You only need to do this if you cannot typeset the manual page
       yourself.

The other two files found here are:

	dmake.tf	- troff source for the manual page, you must use
			  GNU groff to typeset it.
	dmake.nc	- a typeset version of the manual page containing
			  no control characters.

Alternately visit the dmake WWW site, at
