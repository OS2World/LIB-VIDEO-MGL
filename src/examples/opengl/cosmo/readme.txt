This directory contains Cosmo OpenGL specific demonstration programs
that build with Visual C++ 4.2 or later. We have not currently ported these
to the MGL fullscreen GLUT or game framework, but you should be able to
compile them as is directly with Cosmo.

We plan to eventually include more demo's from SGI for Cosmo OpenGL specific
features in here, as well as port the sample code to run under the MGL's
fullscreen OpenGL implementation.
